        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>The Cuscuz is a typical food from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Region,_Brazil">Northeast of Brazil</a> and it's <em>very cheap</em> to prepare! In many places it's used as an alternative for bread.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>2 cups of corn meal</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>1 cup of water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <li>Mix the corn meal and the salt together, in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the water and mix well until all ingredients are moist and mixture has a crumbly texture. Let it stand for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Put water to boil in a pot and on top place a pan to steam with the corn meal inside.</li>
            <li>Cover and cook over low heat for about 15 minutes, until it begins to release its aroma.</li>
