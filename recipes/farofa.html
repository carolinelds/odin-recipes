        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Farofa is a traditional Brazilian side dish made with toasted yuca flour/cassava flour. This dish is kind of a big deal for us and it has a very special place in every Brazilian home from the poorest to the richest. We can prepare it all sorts of different ways; with butter and bacon, or it can be deliciously vegan with just veggies.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>4 cloves of garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
