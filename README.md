# odin-recipes

This project is about creating a simple recipe website with basic HTML skills I have just learned:

- headings
- paragraphs
- bold and italic text
- lists
- links
- images

Guidelines can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/recipes).

Update: live preview is [here](https://carolinelds.github.io/odin-recipes/).
